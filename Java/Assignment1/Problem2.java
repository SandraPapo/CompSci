Problem 2. (4 points)
The ancient Babylonians had an algorithm for determining the square root of a number a. Start with
an initial guess of a/2. Then find the average of your guess g and a/g. Thatâ€™s your next guess. Repeat until
two consecutive guesses are close enough, e.g. less than a threshold t. Write pseudocode for this algorithm.

Pseudocode:


guess = a/2
nextGuess = (guess + a/guess)/2

while(absolute(guess - nextGuess) > t){
	guess = nextGuess
	nextGuess = (guess + a/guess)/2
}

squareroot = guess

        double nextGuess = (guess + a/guess)/2;
	while(Math.abs(guess - nextGuess) > 0.001){
		guess = nextGuess;
		nextGuess = (guess + a/guess)/2;
	}
	System.out.printf("%.2f\n", nextGuess);
    }
